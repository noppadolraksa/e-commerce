                performance criteria and all applicable quality, safety and
                hygiene requirements, and (b) will be free from defects. Each
                Official Shop understands and agrees that it will be responsible
                for any non-conformity or defect in, or any public or private
                recall of, any of the Official Shop Items, and will hold My-Shop

                If an Official Shop is found to have offered or sold any
                Official Shop Item on My-Shop that is restricted under My-Shop’s
                Prohibited and Restricted Items Policy, My-Shop reserves the
                right to, at its sole discretion, remove the offending Official

                adjustments) to Buyers who have purchased such Official Shop
                Items (even if Buyers did not comply with any of the
                requirements described in Section 1 above), in which case
                Official Shop agrees to reimburse My-Shop for all such refunds
                (including any related costs and charges) and authorizes My-Shop
                to deduct such amounts from any amounts payable to Official Shop

                My-Shop will provide Return Air Waybills to Official Shops at no

                Buyers when fulfilling the purchase order made by Buyers on
                My-Shop. If an Official Shop has failed to provide the proper
                Return Air Waybill to a Buyer whose request for refund or return
                has been approved by My-Shop, My-Shop reserves the right to
                elect any method of logistics to facilitate the return of the
                relevant Official Shop Items from such Buyer. Official Shops
                understand and agree that in the case of the foregoing, My-Shop
                has the right to recover from the relevant Official Shop any
                costs incurred in returning the Official Shop Item(s) without a
                Return Air Waybill, including by deducting such amounts from any

                Official Shop Item was listed for sale on the Site (a “Local

                accept delivery of the returned Official Shop Item within a
